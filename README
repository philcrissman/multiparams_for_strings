MultiparamsForStrings
=====================

Adds a condition to the ActiveRecord::Base#execute_callstack_for_multiparameter_attributes method to allow multiparam attribute assignment for strings.

The use case that inspired the plugin was trying to create a phone number field with 3 separate parts.

Installation
============

As with any plugin:

Rails 2.3.x:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/philcrissman/multiparams_for_strings.git
  
Rails 3.0.x:

  rails plugin install git://github.com/philcrissman/multiparams_for_strings.git

Caveat: At the time of writing this, the method in ActiveRecord::Base that this plugin overwrites is the same in Rails 2.3 and 3.0, so it should work the same in either version; if this stops working in Rails 3, please let me know.


Example
=======

No view helper is included in the plugin; you'll need to write your own, or write the input fields yourself. For example, your form might have:

 <input id="user_phone_1s" maxlength="3" name="user[phone(1s)]" size="3" type="text">
 <input id="user_phone_2s" maxlength="3" name="user[phone(2s)]" size="3" type="text">
 <input id="user_phone_3s" maxlength="4" name="user[phone(3s)]" size="4" type="text">

When you submit this, your params will include:

  :user => {"phone(1s)" => '123', "phone(2s)" => '456', "phone(3s)" => '7890', [etc...] }
  
...which ActiveRecord will be able to concatenate so that your finished user will have the phone number '1234567890'

  > User.last.phone
  => "1234567890"


Tests
=====

The tests can be run stand alone; cd to the plugin directory and just

  ruby test/multiparams_for_strings_test.rb
  
The tests do assume you have things like Rails and the sqlite3 gem installed.


Contributing
============

If you find a bug or think of a way to improve this, just let me know or submit a pull request. Thanks in advance.
